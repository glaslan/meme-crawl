            Memes, while many of you probably recognize them as funny internet
            pictures, by socialogical definition they are so much more. Memes
            are loosely defined as units of cultural information, such as a
            practice or idea, that is transmitted eather verbally, or in the
            case of today, non-verbally through self-propagation and imitation.
            In today's hyperconnected world memes have an increased role in
            non-verbal information exchange whether useful or not.

            Ooga Chaka baby is commonly recognized as the first internet meme to
            grace the interwebs. Born as a combination of 3D software showcase
            creation and early gif creation technology. It spread like wildfire
            in the Canadian Pacific through every email inbox. Now some of you
            more refined meme conosures may be asking "what cultural information
            does this artwork spread"? That is a great question and...

              Stonks. Whew baby, we've got diamond hands and we're riding it to
              the moon we went for the G.M.E. YOLO on Robinhood that literally
              can't go tits up at this point and we are making fat tendies. In
              the height of Covid boredom we were treated to the rollercoaster
              that was the GameStop stock pump. A mass community effort that
              made stock shorter's sweat hard and became so notable that it was
              featured on mainstream news. But better yet it gave us the refined
              and destinguished meme that is Stonks.
