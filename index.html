            Memes, while many of you probably recognize them as funny internet
            pictures, by sociological definition they are so much more. Memes
            are loosely defined as units of cultural information, such as a
            practice or idea, that is transmitted either verbally, or in the
            case of today, non-verbally through self-propagation and imitation.
            In today's hyper-connected world memes have an increased role in
            non-verbal information exchange whether useful or not.

            Ooga Chaka baby is commonly recognized as the first internet meme to
            grace the interwebs. Born as a combination of 3D software showcase
            creation and early gif creation technology. It spread like wildfire
            in the Canadian Pacific through every email inbox. Now some of you
            more refined meme connoisseurs may be asking "what cultural information
            does this artwork spread"? That is a great question and...

              These memes quickly evolved from cute dog pics to penguin, badger, and in this case raptor images. Each animal represented a special type of advice. In this case the philosoraptor would provide the viewer with philosophical advice.

              can't go tits up at this point and we are making fat tendies. In
              the height of Covid boredom we were treated to the rollercoaster
              that was the GameStop stock pump. A mass community effort that
              made stock shorter's sweat hard and became so notable that it was
              featured on mainstream news. But better yet it gave us the refined
              and distinguished meme that is Stonks. But enough about that,
              let's move on before I become a bagholder.

              Originating in 1991 this vintage gem comes from the poorly
              translated European port of the Japanese game Zero Wing. Much like
              Ooka chaka baby, this meme was spread via email across in groups.
              However, unlike our next meme it never really made it to the
              mainstream.

              Another oldie but goodie came from our triplet fearing friend
              Gaben himself in the popular game portal. The cake is a lie became
              a memeing sensation for gamers, referencing the in game warning to
              the player that all is not as it seams and they won't have their
              cake and eat it to. From the niche group of early 2000 gamers
              this meme found its way into the mainstream through protests and
              mass media.

        Now we are nearing our end of this meme crawl, but the memes don't end here. The content machine is ever-hungry and requires a constant flow of new memes to consume. So with that I'll leave you with the means to feed the machine. If you aren't already following along you can go to the website link and use this meme generator yourself. This website will be up for the forseeable future so please feel free to explore it. This concludes our meme crawl, I am so sorry for any psychological trauma I may have inflicted over the past ten or so minutes... Oh, my lawyer just messaged me I'm supposed to let you know we aren't liable for any of that trauma and we will not be providing compensation for therapy pertaining to said trauma.
